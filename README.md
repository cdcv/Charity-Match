## Description and Story Behind Charity Match
Charity Match connects donors and volunteers to potential non-profits to assist based on the user’s preferences and allows user to find a local chapter to volunteer with, visit the website and view the mission statement. 

## Our Story
The app idea was created because the developers, Tianna Mosby and Pierre Randall, both have a long history of volunteering with various non-profits. They quickly realized the complications in finding a charity that matches people’s preferences and worked to combat this problem.

## Step-By-Step
This app came to life by using Adobe XD wireframes to design our website layout and using Canva to create our logo. We spent our first day researching color schemes and brainstorming ideas to incorporate in our app and in the logo.
We then began to research API’s which led us to stumbling upon the Charity Navigator API. After comprehending the documentation, we were ready to split up the work. Tianna took on the role of Front End/React Developer, while Pierre handled the databasing and AJAX calls as the Backend Software Engineer.
Pierre researched MERN stack authentication while Tianna researched front end libraries leading us to using Passport and Semantic UI. The app was developed page by page with reusable components being created first. The MongoDB/Mongoose databasing portion followed with the app finally being deployed on Heroku.
